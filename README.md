# Disaster-Management-System
Hello User!
This program is created using PYTHON and MYSQL software applications and requires both for errorless execution. The program also requires a CHROME WEB DRIVER for certain functions. Install the one which is compatible with your web broswer. Link provided below for reference.
https://chromedriver.chromium.org/

When executing the program for the first time, execute the "precursors.py" file first. This will ensure that all the prerequisite necessary data is created.
Also check the password and port of the MySQL application as per your system.
